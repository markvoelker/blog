      <title>DefCore: What OpenStack Devs Need to Know</title>

      <description>As DefCore has become more established over the past year or so, I&amp;rsquo;ve started getting more questions from project developers and PTL&amp;rsquo;s. In most cases, they&amp;rsquo;re interested to know whether things they&amp;rsquo;re thinking about doing in their projects are &amp;ldquo;ok from a DefCore perspective&amp;rdquo; or would be &amp;ldquo;ok from an interoperability perspective&amp;rdquo;. In some cases they&amp;rsquo;re basically just giving a quick (and appreciated!) heads-up and sometimes they&amp;rsquo;re generating terrific discussions.</description>

      <description>DefCore isn&amp;rsquo;t a new creature in the OpenStack community: it&amp;rsquo;s been in discussion since at least 2013. However it was only earlier in 2015 that adherence to DefCore Guidelines became a requirement for products that want to use the OpenStack name and OpenStack Powered logo. As a result, a lot more people are now interested in DefCore than in the past. As we&amp;rsquo;ve started receiving a lot more feedback about DefCore, it&amp;rsquo;s become apparent that there are a few misconceptions out there from folks who are new to DefCore.</description>
