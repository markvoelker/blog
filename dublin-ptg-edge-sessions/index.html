            <p>I recently got snowed in at a hotel in Dublin with a couple hundred people I
consider friends, a well-stocked bar/restaurant, a fantastic event staff, and
a lot of energy.</p>

<p><strong>I know&hellip;<em>poor me</em>, right?</strong> =)</p>

<p><img src="http://markvoelker.github.io/blog/images/snowpenstack_croke_park.jpg" style="height:450px;width:600px" title="Croke Park as the storm begins to settle in.  The venue closed Thursday afternoon and we all crammed into the Croke Park Hotel across the street."/></p>

<p>Before Storm Emma and the Beast from the East settled in on the OpenStack
Project Team Gathering and forced the Croke Park Stadium to close (thereby
giving birth to the hashtag
&ldquo;<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23snowpenstack">snowpenstack</a>&rdquo;), we got a solid
start to the week.  I spent most of my Monday at a meeting with Board of
Directors and most of my Tuesday at a meeting with the
<a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Fog_Edge_Massively_Distributed_Clouds">FEMDC SIG</a>
talking about Edge computing use cases.  As with any long technical discussion,
there was a lot to take in and try to keep straight in my head later, so I
thought it&rsquo;d be useful to dump some of my notes here.</p>

<p>First and foremost, I should note that my ramblings here are a supplement to
the official etherpads we used during the event for collaborative note-taking:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/edge-ptg-dublin">The main agenda etherpad</a></li>
<li><a href="https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/edge-use-case-questions">Edge use case questions</a></li>
<li><a href="https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/edge-gap-analysis">Edge gap analysis</a></li>
<li>And finally, the pad we spent most of the afternoon with: <a href="https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/edge-gap-analysis">Alan&rsquo;s Problems</a>  (&ldquo;Alan&rdquo; is <a href="https://twitter.com/Alan_Meadows">Alan Meadows</a> who
generously contributed a lot of real-world experience and suggestions to the
discussion based on his work at AT&amp;T.)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not familiar with Edge use cases, it&rsquo;s probably worth a brief pause
here to check out
<a href="https://www.openstack.org/assets/edge/OpenStack-EdgeWhitepaper-v3-online.pdf">Cloud Edge Computing: Beyond the Data Center</a>,
a whitepaper the group published earlier this year.  One important factor in
the use cases we&rsquo;re talking about here is that &ldquo;the cloud&rdquo; will be distributed
to a lot of different sites in geographically dispersed areas.  This is a big
change in thinking if you&rsquo;ve been working in &ldquo;classical cloud computing&rdquo; where
the general notion is to pool a (potentially tremendous) amount of
compute/storage/etc resources into one or a few large datacenters.  Imagine,
for example, that you want a small amount of computing capacity to be available
at every cell tower you own in China.
Or that you want to run virtualized applications on customer premise equipment:
like every set-top box in New York City.  Also,
consider that your compute capacity might not even stay in one place: you might
have some capacity in a train or a connected bus barreling down the Autobahn.  Not
only might these pools of capacity move, they might also disappear for a time
and then reappear later.</p>

<p>Keeping capacity close to the end user is one of the many factors that makes
edge computing use cases &ldquo;squeeze&rdquo; OpenStack at different points than classical
large-pools-of-capacity-in-big-datacenters use cases might.  If you have hundreds
of thousands of pools of capacity scattered across a large geographic area, is
it actually practical to centralize the control plane?  Do you need tiers as
opposed to a flat or two-level hierarchy?  Latency certainly seems like a
challenge in these environments, but also resiliency: you certainly don&rsquo;t want
the capacity at all those cell towers to be rendered unusable if a centralized
component goes down.</p>

<p>The morning started off with some thinking about how we wanted to approach the
discussion for the rest of the day.  Based on previous discussions, two basic
strategies were in play: a &ldquo;top-down&rdquo; approach where there are multiple OpenStack
instances managed by some higher-level entity, or a &ldquo;bottom-up&rdquo; approach where
a cluster of OpenStack instances have some shared components that provide
management (for example: they might all share a Keystone instance).  After some
discussion, it was decided to focus most of the rest of the day&rsquo;s discussion on
an architecture that features multiple (potentially thousands) of regions, with
some top-level orchestration to help push common components like images or users
to multiple regions.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not familiar with the concept of regions in OpenStack, here&rsquo;s a quick
primer: generally speaking, regions in OpenStack are thought of as geographically
distinct OpenStack entities under common control. For example, in a &ldquo;classical
cloud&rdquo; use case, I might have a private cloud with a &ldquo;us-west&rdquo; and &ldquo;us-east&rdquo;
region for users within my company based in San Francisco and New York.  In
most cases, regions are separate API endpoints and each region has it&rsquo;s own
control plane&ndash;that is, it&rsquo;s own instances of things like Nova, Neutron, etc.
In some deployments they may share some components (typically Keystone or Horizon)
but in many cases those, too, are unique to each site.</p>

<p>If we expand the use of regions to Edge use cases, you might think of a few
servers at every cell tower constituting a region, or an entire OpenStack region
consisting of a lightweight deployment all housed on a set top box.  As the
number of regions piles up in the Edge world, it becomes quickly evident that
some way of managing all those regions is needed.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting before we go on that this is just one deployment scenario, not
necessarily &ldquo;the&rdquo; deployment scenario that fits all use cases.  Depending on
your use case, it&rsquo;s easy to imagine variants: for example, instead of making
each set-top box in an apartment building it&rsquo;s own region, I might put a control
plane in an electrical closet somewhere and have each set top box serve simply as
a compute host.</p>

<p>Having chosen an architecture to hone in on for the day, Alan began relating
some of the challenges he&rsquo;d experienced with such an approach and tooling
currently in place. That prompted
<a href="https://twitter.com/jbryce">Jonathan Bryce</a> to whip up a new etherpad for
<a href="https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/edge-alans-problems">Alan&rsquo;s Problems</a> so we
could dig in and work out how to solve them.  An advantage of this architectural
approach is that it&rsquo;s closer at hand: we already have capabilities in the
OpenStack software to build a substantial portion of such an architecture (for
example: the concept of regions has been a thing in OpenStack since the very
early days).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll spare you most of the details of the discussion since much of it is captured
<a href="https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/edge-alans-problems">in the etherpad</a> but
essentially we started boiling things down into something that looks like this:</p>

<pre>
-------------  ----------- -------
| "Golden   |  | "Golden | | NKB |      < Centralized
|  Keystone"|  |  Glance"| |     |        (or tiered)       
-------------  ----------- -------
         \        |          /
          \       |         /
          ==================
          /       |    |||  \
         /        |    |||   \
---------- ----------       ----------
|region 1| |region 2| |...| |region n|      < Geographically dispersed
---------- ----------       ----------
</pre>

<p>The general idea here is that in a (massively)multi-region architecture, there
are probably still a great number of things that you&rsquo;d want to be propagated
to all or just some regions.  For example: when I onboard a new user or create
a new project, I might want that new user to appear in all regions, or I might
want that project just to exist in certain regions (perhaps &ldquo;all regions in
a certain geography&rdquo; or &ldquo;all regions that are actually trains&rdquo;, or even
&ldquo;all regions that have a policy entitlement to run certain workloads&rdquo;).  Glance
is conceptually similar: I might have a certain VNF image that I want propagated
to all or many regions. However I as a human being would probably be really
frustrated if I had to upload an image or create a user manually on hundreds or
thousands of endpoints.  It&rsquo;s worth calling out that &ldquo;create&rdquo; is just one action:
I might also need to update things, delete them, see what their state is, etc.
Moreover, I as a human don&rsquo;t want to have to keep tabs on that over time and make
sure that if I asked for certain objects to be in certain places that they get
there and stay there.</p>

<p>This is where the concept of &ldquo;intent&rdquo; comes in (and with it, the mysterious &ldquo;NKB&rdquo;
block in the diagram above).  Imagine if I only had to push an image to a single
instance of Glance (a &ldquo;golden&rdquo; Glance if you will) and in doing so I could also
issue some statement of intent.  That statement might be something like:</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Here is my image, it should be in all regions tagged &lsquo;set-top-box&rsquo;.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Here is my image, it should be available to download in all regions marked
&lsquo;cell-towers-with-1-mile-of-denver&rsquo; and should actually be present in all
regions marked &lsquo;high-use-towers-within-1-mile-of-denver&rsquo;.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Here is my image, nuke it from orbit in all regions.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>Getting an image into Glance is pretty standard stuff: I can simply deploy a
centralized Glance server (or more likely a horizontally-scaled set of them).
The &ldquo;intent&rdquo; bit could <em>possibly</em> be accomplished using existing metadata
primitives available in various OpenStack services: things like image metadata,
Neutron tags, extra specs, etc.  Again: it might be useful to make use of
existing primitives because they already exist, so we can get a head start on
getting a solution deployed.  We could alternately have a single service that
provides a more descriptive and unified language for this.  We then also need
something that carries out the intent that we&rsquo;ve provided&ndash;and makes sure it
stays carried out.  E.g. if the image I said should be in a certain region gets
deleted somehow, that abnormal state should be detected and resolved by having
the image synchronized from the &ldquo;golden Glance&rdquo; again.</p>

<p>That last bit involves carrying out actions across multiple regions (among
other things).  Orchestrating an action over multiple regions sounds a bit
like what the
<a href="http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/kingbird/tree/README.rst">Kingbird project</a>
does, though it also has other elements to it (one might imagine, for example,
using something like
<a href="http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/congress/tree/README.rst">Congress</a> to
define policy or &ldquo;intent&rdquo;.  For the sake of simplicity in conversation, we
referred to the synchronization/intent/policy service as simply &ldquo;New Kingbird&rdquo;
(or &ldquo;NKB&rdquo;) for lack of a better name.  Elements of what we need for such a
service already exist in parts in other services, but it&rsquo;s likely we need to
build either some glue or a new component for this part of the architecture.</p>

<p>One point was reiterated several times that bears repeating here as well: any
time you&rsquo;re dealing with an intent-based or policy-based system with a
potentially very large number of endpoints to manage, you also need to be able
to query the system to see what it&rsquo;s progress is toward fulfilling your stated
intent.  If we imagine a &ldquo;New Kingbird&rdquo; component, that means I should be able
to ask it things like &ldquo;Hey, I asked you to push this image to a bunch of regions
&hellip;is it there yet?&rdquo; and have it answer &ldquo;Your image now exists in region A,
I&rsquo;m pushing it to C, D, and F right now, E-G will be next, and oh by the way I
got a connection timeout from B when I tried 13 seconds ago so I&rsquo;ll try it again
in 47 seconds (which will mark my fourth attempt).&rdquo;</p>

<p>I think that provides a basic architectural overview&hellip;that said, there were
a ton of details also discussed.  I&rsquo;ll note a few here, but once again I&rsquo;ll
invite you to
<a href="https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/edge-alans-problems">check out the etherpad</a>
for more.</p>

<ul>
<li>We should not assume that a given user has administrative rights either to the
&ldquo;golden&rdquo; components or to all regions.  For example, a given user might state
his intent to push a new project to region A, but his access rights might only
allow him to push it to B, C, and D.</li>
<li>There is a need for some sort of portal (I for one dare not say &ldquo;single pane
of glass&rdquo;!) to get a general overview of what&rsquo;s going on and what state things
are in.  Here again though, privilege levels and roles should be considered.</li>
<li>The diagram I&rsquo;ve drawn above shows a simple two-level hierarchy.  One should
not assume that&rsquo;s the way it would actually work for a substantially large and
dispersed use case: there might actually be hierarchies here (for example,
a &ldquo;golden keystone&rdquo; that serves all regions in a metropolitan area rather than
an entire country&hellip;but that can pull users/projects it wants to propagate to
it&rsquo;s child regions from a central &ldquo;golden Keystone&rdquo; higher up).</li>
<li>It should also not be assumed that all regions need to pull directly from a
single &ldquo;golden&rdquo; instance, though that&rsquo;s perhaps the easiest thing to diagram
to kickstart a conversation.  Instead, imagine a world where Region A might
receive an instruction that it needs to download a particular image.  It could
get it from a central &ldquo;golden Glance&rdquo; but it might also know that it has
high bandwidth/low latency connections to Region B, C, and D available.  Upon
querying, it determines that C has already downloaded the image, so A fetches
it from C rather than going to a central source.  This sort of peer-to-peer
structure bears some resemblance to other things that already have code and
protocols established (for example:
<a href="http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html">BitTorrent</a> or perhaps even
blockchains for bits about intent and assertion).</li>
<li>One advantage of this architecture is that it provides a degree of separation
of concerns.  Imagine a simple two-level hierarchy with a &ldquo;golden Glance&rdquo;
and a hundred regions beneath it.  It&rsquo;s simple for the admin, since he can
push an image to one place and have it propagate to many.  But it also provides
some resiliency: if that &ldquo;golden Glance&rdquo; goes down, all the regions can keep
operating (they simply won&rsquo;t receive new images or commands to delete existing
ones, etc until the golden Glance returns).  If something <em>truly</em> catastrophic
happens, one would also theoretically still be able to use the API endpoints
of the individual regions to re-exert control in the absence of the centralized
components (would it be tedious and require a lot of foreach loops?  Yes.
Would it be possible to do things?  Also yes.).  Add in the torrent-like
capability mentioned in the previous bullet point, and you get an even more
resilient architecture.</li>
<li>There are some discernable differences in the types of things we&rsquo;d want to
propagate down to regions.  For example: a &ldquo;user&rdquo; or &ldquo;project&rdquo; amounts to
a few rows in a database (which is small and fast to push even on relatively
low speed/high latency links).  A VM image, on the other hand, might be
several gigabytes and take considerably longer.  Those sort of differences
should be taken into account, and point to the need for things like the
ability to query current state vs intended and progress to synchronizing the
two.  It also points to the potential use case for &ldquo;lazy loading&rdquo; of some
object types.  I might know that a give image is going to be needed in a
handful of regions and declare my intent that it should be pushed down to
all of them.  I might also know that the same image <em>might</em> be needed in
some others, but not necessarily and it might be ok if it took a while to
start up.  For those regions, I might merely want to declare intent that the
image be available to them (e.g. it resides in another region they know how
to talk to, or in a central/regional place that they can download from) and
let them fetch it when and if it&rsquo;s needed.</li>
<li>Another service that might factor into this design is the
<a href="https://docs.openstack.org/nova/queens/user/placement.html">placement service</a>
from Nova (which might
<a href="http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2018-March/128004.html">eventually be extracted</a>
into it&rsquo;s own standalone repository/service.  It already offers things like
<a href="https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/user/placement.html#traits-api">traits</a>
and <a href="https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/nova-specs/specs/newton/implemented/generic-resource-pools.html">resource pools</a>
that would be potentially useful.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s also entirely possible that not all regions will be the same: some might
be configured differently than others or might be running a different version
of the OpenStack software (some might not even run all the services&hellip;I might
have Manilla in some but not all regions).  In fact, it could be argued that
this becomes a virtual certainly in massive edge cases with a large number of
edges that may temporarily drop off the map.  Resolving differences is
something that needs to be addressed, and again there are some existing tools
like <a href="https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/oaktree/tree/README.rst">Oaktree</a>
and <a href="https://docs.openstack.org/shade/latest/">Shade</a> that might be useful for
doing so.</li>
<li>One could also imagine <em>completely</em> different ways to solve these problems.
This architecture isn&rsquo;t meant to be a final end-all-be-all for all
users and use cases&ndash;rather, it was meant as something concrete that could be
used for discussion to flush out what problems exist, could be solved, and
need more consideration.</li>
</ul>
